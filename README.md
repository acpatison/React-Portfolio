## Description
üîç With this project, I utilized React.js to deploy a more up-to-date version of my original portfolios. Additionally, I updated all my projects and deployments that I had previously completed. I also included a form in order for anyone who visits my deployed website in the future to reach out to me via email with a message or comment.
